# CRM-Campaign-Optimization

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes customer engagement data from three CRM channels—Emails, SMS, and WhatsApp—to improve campaign targeting and conversion rates. The objective is to identify segment-specific response patterns and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing CRM strategies.  

## Problem Statement  
Businesses often use multiple communication channels to engage with customers, but determining the most effective channel for different segments can be challenging. This analysis aims to evaluate customer response data to optimize CRM strategies and improve engagement and conversions.  

## Objectives  
### 1. Data Extraction (SQL)  
- Retrieve user engagement metrics from a CRM database.  
- Calculate conversion rates for campaigns across different channels.  
- Analyze segment-specific response patterns (open rates, click rates, and conversions).  

### 2. Data Analysis (Excel)  
- Import query results into Excel for further analysis.  
- Use pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting to visualize trends.  
- Compare the effectiveness of campaigns across different channels.  

### 3. Insights & Recommendations  
- Summarize key findings in a structured report.  
- Identify the most effective CRM channels for different user segments.  
- Provide recommendations for improving engagement and conversion rates.
