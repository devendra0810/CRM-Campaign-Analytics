# CRM-Campaign-Optimization

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes customer engagement data from three CRM channels—Emails, SMS, and WhatsApp—to improve campaign targeting and conversion rates. The objective is to identify segment-specific response patterns and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing CRM strategies.  

## Problem Statement  
Businesses often use multiple communication channels to engage with customers, but determining the most effective channel for different segments can be challenging. This analysis aims to evaluate customer response data to optimize CRM strategies and improve engagement and conversions.  

## Objectives  
### 1. Data Extraction (SQL)  
- Retrieve user engagement metrics from a CRM database.  
- Calculate conversion rates for campaigns across different channels.  
- Analyze segment-specific response patterns (open rates, click rates, and conversions).  

### 2. Data Analysis (Excel)  
- Import query results into Excel for further analysis.  
- Use pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting to visualize trends.  
- Compare the effectiveness of campaigns across different channels.  

### 3. Insights & Findings  
- Analyzed engagement trends and identified patterns across different CRM channels.  
- Evaluated the effectiveness of campaigns by comparing response rates (open, click, and conversion rates) for various user segments.  
- Provided data-driven observations on the most effective channels and campaign types.  

### 4. Recommendations  
- Suggested potential strategies to enhance engagement and conversion rates based on analyzed data.  
- Highlighted areas where segment-specific targeting can improve overall CRM effectiveness.  

## Technologies Used  
- **SQL**: Data extraction and querying.  
- **Excel**: Data analysis, visualization, and reporting.  

## Assumptions & Limitations
